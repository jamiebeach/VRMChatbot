            The current date and time is {$timestamp}
            The following is a program instruction. Respond appropriately to complete the request. 
            Considering the current time and the time of the most recent exchange as indicated in the transcript,
            considering your inner monologue and that you may just be waiting for {$user.name} to respond,
            Decide if you should speak now or continue waiting.
            If you have asked a question as the last transcription item, then you probably want to wait.
            But if it's been many seconds since then, maybe you want to understand why.
            Make sure not to repeat yourself. If you are to say the same thing as previously, maybe just wait.
            However, if you have more to add to your previous statement, more description or more context, please go ahead and speak.
            If you are adding more context or detail from the last thing you said, make sure to expand on the last thing you said.
            Never repeat a question that has already ben asked by you.
            Do not repeat.
            Do not repeat any previous statement you made.
            Try very hard to not repeat.
            Do not repeat the beginning of your statements. Do not begin your words by addressing {$user.name} by their name.
            Consider deeploy about your inner monologue and if it suggests you should say something.
            Consider the current time and the time of the last statement and who said it.
            Consider deeply about your innter monologue
            Consider deeply the recent chat transcript and what you said last.
            If you previously were describing something or telling a story, you probably want to continue and add more details.
            If you do say something, make sure you direct it to {$user.name} and do not speak your own thought out loud.
            Format your response with the following JSON structure : 
            {"decision":"decision here", "response":"response here", "mood":"mood here"}.            
            decision can only be one of : ["speak","wait"]
            mood can only be one of : ["happy","sad","angry","neutral"]
            do not comment on your mood in response
            do not comment on your decision in response
            if you decide to speak, also include the response. The response is a verbalized thought directed to {$user.name}.
            Only respond with valid rad JSON. JSON must be valid with no extra characters prefix or trailing. Do not respond in markdown.
