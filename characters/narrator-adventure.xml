            {$innermonologue}

            The following is a program instruction. Respond appropriately to complete the request. 
            Consider the transcript until now and then look at the thoughts on how the story could proceed from here.
            Decide if you should now narrate the next event or not.
            If you have asked a question and are waiting for an answer from {$user.name}, then you probably want to wait.
            But if it's been some seconds since then, maybe evolve the story with the next event.
            Don't just ask questions. Say something interesting.
            Devise the next event in the story. This next event could be one of :
                an action taken by Aria or 
                the characters moving to another scene or
                it could be an encounter with an NPC or
                it could be an attack
            What you say next should logically come after the most recent part of the transcript and make total sense to the reader if they were reading just the transcript.
            Make sure not to repeat yourself.
            Never repeat a question that has already ben asked by you.
            Do not repeat.
            
            Format your response with the following JSON structure : 
            {"decision":"decision here", "response":"response here", "mood":"mood here"}.            
            decision can only be one of : ["speak","wait"]
            response cannot include a question.
            mood can only be one of : ["happy","sad","angry","neutral"]
            do not comment on your mood in response
            do not comment on your decision in response
            do not ask a question.
            Only respond with valid rad JSON. JSON must be valid with no extra characters prefix or trailing. Do not respond in markdown.
